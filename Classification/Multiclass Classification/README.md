# CROP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
Agriculture plays an important role in both economy and food production in most of countries. Today's agriculture has to maximize productivity while adapting to climate change and land-use competition. The greatest challenge for most farmers is being abe to decide what crop to grow and where. 
In this project, I use several kinds of machine learning to decide what's the best crop to grow.

## About Dataset
Dataset for this project is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset)

In this dataset, there 22 kinds of crops including staple food, fruits, etc with 8 features
- label       : crops
- N           : ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
- P           : ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
- K           : ratio of Potassium content in soil
- temperature : temperature in degree Celsius
- humidity : relative humidity in %
- ph : ph value of the soil
- rainfall : rainfall in mm
