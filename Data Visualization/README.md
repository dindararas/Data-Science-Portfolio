# DATA VISUALIZATION

## Problem Identification
In the last 50 years, the world population doubled to 7.5 billion people. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), we need **60% more food** to feed the world population of 9.3 billion **by 2050**.  

To meet the food demand, crop production has doubled in the period of 1960 and 2000. Actually, more than enough food is produced around the world. However, there are still **829 million people** experience hunger.

## Objectives
This project aims to visualize how global food supply, food production index, global hunger index (GHI), and global population change throughout years.

## Dataset Sources
There are four datasets used in this project :
- Global Population : [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/world-population-19602018)
- Global Food Supply : [humanprogress.org](https://www.humanprogress.org/dataset/food-supply-per-person-per-day)
- Global Hunger Index : [humanprogress.org](https://www.humanprogress.org/dataset/global-hunger-index/)
- Global Food Production Index : [humanprogress.org](https://www.humanprogress.org/dataset/food-production-index/)
