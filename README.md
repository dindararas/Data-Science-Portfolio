# Data Science Portfolio

This respository containts portfolio of data science projects for self-learning. All of projects in this respository are presented in Google Colab.

For more information about me, you can visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dinda-raraswati/)

## NOTE 
I use **plotly** for data visualization in all the projects, but plotly graphs can not be displayed in Github, so **please check out my portfolio on Google Colab**

## CONTENTS
- **Machine Learning**
  - [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/dindararas/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Classification/Binary%20Classification/Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb) : Machine learning models and deep learning model are used to predict whether customer will churn the e-commerce platform or not. 
  - [Crop Recommendation System](https://github.com/dindararas/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Classification/Multiclass%20Classification/Crop_Recommendation.ipynb) :T his project including exploratory data analysis, clustering, and building predictive model. Analyzing optimum environment condition for specific crops, implementing clustering based on the features, and testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that predicts the best crop planted in given environmental condition.

- **Data Visualization**
  - [Global Food Production and Population](https://github.com/dindararas/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Visualization/Global_Food_Production_and_Population.ipynb) : Data analysis of how global food production and population changes throughout the years.
  
- **Time Series Prediction**
  - [Air Temperature Time Series Prediction](https://github.com/dindararas/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Prediction/Air_Temperature_Time_Series_Prediction.ipynb) : Comparing LSTM and CNN performance to predict the next month's air temperature in Jakarta.
    
- **Recommendation System**
  - [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/dindararas/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Recommendation%20System/Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb) : Building content-based recommendation system based on movie description, genre, keywords, cast, and direction by using TMDB500 dataset.
