# CROP YIELD PREDICTION
The science of training machines to learn and produce models for future predictions is widely used, and not for nothing. Agriculture plays a critical role in the global economy. With the continuing expansion of the human population understanding worldwide crop yield is central to addressing food security challenges and reducing the impacts of climate change.

Crop yield prediction is an important agricultural problem. The Agricultural yield primarily depends on weather conditions (rain, temperature, etc), pesticides and accurate information about history of crop yield is an important thing for making decisions related to agricultural risk management and future predictions.

## About Dataset
Dataset for this project is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset)

In this dataset, there are 10 kinds of crops with 7 features :
- Area : country names around the world
- Item : kinds of crops
- Year 
- hg/ha_yield : yield for each crop in specific country and year
- average_rain_fall_mm_per_year  : the amount of rainfall in every country every year
- pesticides_tonnes : the amount of pesticides needed for each crop
- avg_temp : the average temperature in every country every year

## Models Used
In this project, I compare Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regressor, and Gradient Boosting to predict crop yield.
