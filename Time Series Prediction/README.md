# AIR TEMPERATURE TIME SERIES PREDICTION

Time series prediction is the task of building a model fitted to historical data with the goal of forecasting future values.
The prediction of air temperature is an important task since it affects crop production and other life aspects.

## About Dataset
Dataset is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)

In link above, there are other dataset categorized by country, major city, and state. In this project, I focus on Jakarta from 1985 - 2013.

## Model Used
In this project, I establish and evaluate deep learning methods (LSTM and CNN) for predicting Monthly Air Temperature in Jakarta. I use Bayesian optimization from keras-tuner library to tune hyperparameters
